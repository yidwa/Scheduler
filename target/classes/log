update the Topology initopology(), for the shape not equals but contains to make sure that multiple line topology can be submitted and modelled .
update the way to assign. each topology goes to specific supervisor for testing purpose except for thoses spouts one_to_one_scheduler findSupervisorT


Jan 17
Backup code before changing the data update
works for modelling and system comparing

Update StormRest for updatecomponetthread. give details of execution of each executor for scheduling purpose.
also update spouting thread update

Feb 13 
update optimisation with method reschedulingupdate , that indicate the most suitable vm type for given thread
add 'rescheduler' in metricupdate and keep it as the result of reschedulingupdate method

The topology needs to be named as "line/star/diamond ***_1(1-3 priority), 3 - small 2- medium 1 -large

Jul 20
QoS scheduler- almost work, need to check if all executors have been allocated.

Jul 22
find out the pid that listening on port 6627
sudo lsof -n -i :6627 | grep LISTEN

Jul 25 
Add the priority queue, need to think about map the topologies into queues

Jul 31
Create the QoS_meta scheduler, it reads meta site from supervisor and then allocate task to the corresponding host
For each queue, it has one small, one medium and one large instance, the task with priority 1 will go to the s1,m1 or l1

Update the dataretrival and queue udpate so that the queue arrival rate and service rate can be obtained.
the next step would be estimate the waiting time for each queue

Aug 3

the waiting time of each queue can be estimated.
need to clarify the channel number, the number of servers?
how to accurately estimate the watiing time?

Aug 4
update the waiting of queue to average buffer time plus the execution time
the watiing time can be estimated now
need to think about the optimisation, cost function and constraint

Aug 15
Need to configured to switch the scheduling
 1) mu -> qu
 2) data retrival performance metric -> queue update
